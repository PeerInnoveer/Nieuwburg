            Nieuwburg Pty (Ltd) started off as a father and son company that came into being as N&A Steelworks. It received a steady income and allowed the family the put bread on the table. Ten years later "Nicolaas snr." stepped down into retirement and allowed his son to take the lead. A couple of years ago "Nicolaas jnr." was approached by his brother in law Pierre van Rensburg who was interested in starting up his own custom wood works and artisans company. He figured their best bet to succeed would be to go at it together and take N&A Steelworks to the next level. Both felt the company needed a fresh look and so Nieuwburg was born, a mix of both surnames.</p>
